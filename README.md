This report presents an analysis of the weather dataset, including wind speed values, the number of occurrences for clear weather, wind speed exactly 4 km/h, mean visibility, standard deviation of pressure, relative humidity variance, and correlation between variables. Here are the key findings:

Wind Speed Values: The dataset records various wind speed values ranging from 0 km/h to 83 km/h. These values represent the strength of the wind at different instances.
Number of Clear Weather: The dataset captures 1,326 instances of clear weather conditions. Clear weather indicates the absence of significant cloud cover or precipitation.
Wind Speed Exactly 4 km/h: Among the recorded wind speed values, there are 474 instances where the wind speed is exactly 4 km/h.
Mean Visibility: The average visibility in the dataset is approximately 27.66 kilometers. This value represents the typical distance at which objects can be clearly seen under the given weather conditions.
Standard Deviation of Pressure: The standard deviation of the pressure values is approximately 0.84 kPa. It indicates the degree of variation or dispersion in the atmospheric pressure measurements.
Relative Humidity Variance: The dataset exhibits a variance of approximately 286.25 in relative humidity. This variance represents the spread or dispersion of relative humidity values across the dataset.
Correlation Analysis:

Correlation between Temperature and Relative Humidity: The correlation coefficient between temperature and relative humidity is -0.2202. This negative correlation suggests a weak relationship between these variables. As the temperature tends to increase, the relative humidity tends to decrease slightly, and vice versa. However, the correlation is not very strong.
Correlation between Wind Speed and Visibility: The correlation coefficient between wind speed and visibility is 0.0049. This value indicates a very weak positive correlation. There is almost no significant relationship between wind speed and visibility. Changes in wind speed do not correspond to notable changes in visibility, and vice versa.
Furthermore, the analysis of wind speed by season highlights interesting observations. Autumn and spring exhibit similar average wind speeds, both averaging around 14.5 km/h. These seasons experience moderate wind conditions without extreme calmness or high wind intensity. Summer demonstrates slightly lower wind speeds, around 13.5 km/h, indicating relatively calmer conditions. On the other hand, winter stands out with the highest average wind speed among the seasons, averaging around 16.9 km/h. This implies that winter experiences stronger and gustier winds compared to the other seasons.

The analysis provides valuable insights into wind speed variations across different seasons, contributing to a better understanding of typical wind patterns and conditions throughout the year.
