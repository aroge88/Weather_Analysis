# Weather_Analysis

# Context:
In this analysis, I utilized two individual Pandas files to analyze the weather data. In the first part, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where I implemented code to examine the column names, visualize distributions, compute statistical results, summarize the data, identify null values, and generate value counts. This allowed me to gain an initial understanding of the dataset and explore its basic characteristics.

For the second part of the analysis, I formulated specific questions to delve deeper into the datasets and extract more meaningful insights. By addressing these questions, I aimed to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends within the data. This involved performing additional calculations, aggregations, and comparisons to derive valuable information from the weather dataset.

By employing these two distinct approaches, I was able to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the weather data. The EDA phase provided an initial overview of the dataset, while the subsequent question-based analysis allowed for a more focused exploration, enabling me to extract more detailed insights and draw meaningful conclusions.

# EDA

Temperature (Temp_C):

The average temperature is 8.798144 degrees Celsius.
The temperature ranges from -23.3 to 33 degrees Celsius.
There is a considerable variability in temperature, as indicated by the standard deviation of 11.687883.
The temperature distribution spans a wide range, encompassing both cold and hot temperatures.
Dew Point Temperature (Dew Point Temp_C):

The mean dew point temperature is 2.555294 degrees Celsius.
The dew point temperature ranges from -28.5 to 24.4 degrees Celsius.
There is a notable variability in dew point temperature, with a standard deviation of 10.883072.
The dew point temperature measures the moisture content in the air and is relatively close to the temperature values.
Relative Humidity (Rel Hum_%):

The average relative humidity is 67.431694%.
The relative humidity ranges from 18% to 100%.
There is a moderate variability in relative humidity, as indicated by the standard deviation of 16.918881.
Relative humidity represents the moisture content in the air relative to its maximum capacity.
Wind Speed (Wind Speed_km/h):

The mean wind speed is 14.945469 km/h.
The wind speed ranges from 0 to 83 km/h.
There is a considerable variability in wind speed, as indicated by the standard deviation of 8.688696.
Wind speed represents the strength of the air movement.
Visibility (Visibility_km):

The average visibility is 27.664447 km.
The visibility ranges from 0.2 to 48.3 km.
There is a notable variability in visibility, with a standard deviation of 12.622688.
Visibility represents the distance at which objects can be seen clearly.
Pressure (Press_kPa):

The mean atmospheric pressure is 101.051623 kPa.
The atmospheric pressure ranges from 97.52 to 103.65 kPa.
There is a relatively low variability in atmospheric pressure, with a standard deviation of 0.844005.
Atmospheric pressure represents the force exerted by the atmosphere.
In summary, the comparison and contrast of the summary statistics highlight the variations and ranges of each variable. Some variables, such as temperature and dew point temperature, exhibit wider ranges and higher variability, indicating diverse weather conditions. On the other hand, variables like relative humidity and atmospheric pressure show narrower ranges and lower variability, suggesting more consistent patterns. The comparison provides insights into the different aspects of the weather conditions captured by each variable and allows for a better understanding of the overall weather patterns in the dataset.

# Analysis: 

This report presents an analysis of the weather dataset, including wind speed values, the number of occurrences for clear weather, wind speed exactly 4 km/h, mean visibility, standard deviation of pressure, relative humidity variance, and correlation between variables. Here are the key findings:

Wind Speed Values: The dataset records various wind speed values ranging from 0 km/h to 83 km/h. These values represent the strength of the wind at different instances.
Number of Clear Weather: The dataset captures 1,326 instances of clear weather conditions. Clear weather indicates the absence of significant cloud cover or precipitation.
Wind Speed Exactly 4 km/h: Among the recorded wind speed values, there are 474 instances where the wind speed is exactly 4 km/h.
Mean Visibility: The average visibility in the dataset is approximately 27.66 kilometers. This value represents the typical distance at which objects can be clearly seen under the given weather conditions.
Standard Deviation of Pressure: The standard deviation of the pressure values is approximately 0.84 kPa. It indicates the degree of variation or dispersion in the atmospheric pressure measurements.
Relative Humidity Variance: The dataset exhibits a variance of approximately 286.25 in relative humidity. This variance represents the spread or dispersion of relative humidity values across the dataset.
Correlation Analysis:

Correlation between Temperature and Relative Humidity: The correlation coefficient between temperature and relative humidity is -0.2202. This negative correlation suggests a weak relationship between these variables. As the temperature tends to increase, the relative humidity tends to decrease slightly, and vice versa. However, the correlation is not very strong.
Correlation between Wind Speed and Visibility: The correlation coefficient between wind speed and visibility is 0.0049. This value indicates a very weak positive correlation. There is almost no significant relationship between wind speed and visibility. Changes in wind speed do not correspond to notable changes in visibility, and vice versa.
Furthermore, the analysis of wind speed by season highlights interesting observations. Autumn and spring exhibit similar average wind speeds, both averaging around 14.5 km/h. These seasons experience moderate wind conditions without extreme calmness or high wind intensity. Summer demonstrates slightly lower wind speeds, around 13.5 km/h, indicating relatively calmer conditions. On the other hand, winter stands out with the highest average wind speed among the seasons, averaging around 16.9 km/h. This implies that winter experiences stronger and gustier winds compared to the other seasons.

The analysis provides valuable insights into wind speed variations across different seasons, contributing to a better understanding of typical wind patterns and conditions throughout the year.

# Recommendations: 

In order to make the most of the insights gained from the weather dataset analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:
Firstly, it is essential to continue collecting and analyzing weather data to further enhance weather monitoring and reporting capabilities. This ongoing data collection will provide a more comprehensive understanding of weather patterns, trends, and anomalies. By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, more accurate and timely weather forecasts can be generated. This will enable individuals, businesses, and organizations to plan their activities, optimize resource allocation, and mitigate risks associated with weather conditions.
Secondly, given the findings related to wind speed, visibility, and temperature-relative humidity relationships, it is recommended to develop tailored strategies and guidelines for various sectors. For instance, transportation and logistics companies can incorporate wind speed data into route planning and scheduling to optimize fuel efficiency and ensure safe transportation. Visibility improvement initiatives, such as air quality monitoring and pollution control measures, can be implemented to enhance visibility during low-visibility periods. Additionally, understanding the relationship between temperature and relative humidity can support urban planning, building design, and energy management strategies that consider human comfort and energy demand.
